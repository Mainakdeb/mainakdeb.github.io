								<h3>Ruby</h3>
								<p>Ruby was completely alien to me. Google was my only friend. The syntax was easy to grasp. I faced tons of errors but StackOverflow had my back.</p>

							<section>
								<span class="center"> <img src="images/Rust_logo.png" style="width:115px;height:100px;">
								</span>
								<h3>Rust</h3>
								<p>Once again, I didn't even know that Rust-lang existed, forget about RegEx. Youtube Tutorials and the official docs came in handy.</p>

								<h3>Web</h3>
								<p>I had zero knowledge about HTML and JS, w3schools and Youtube tutorials kept me from drowning. </p>

								<h3>Python</h3>
								<p>The Hackerrank and Codeforces problems brushed up my basic problem solving skills. Captcha breaking was fun, the Tesseract OCR engine came in handy. Solving Reverse-me wasn't easy though, it took me 1 whole hour to understand what a XOR gate exactly is. </p>

									<h3>GitHub_GraphQL</h3>
									<p>GraphQL was completely new to me. The learning curve was a bit steep in this case. GraphiQL(in-browser tool) came in handy for  validating and testing GraphQL queries.</p>

									<h3>Project_Euler</h3>
									<p>The logic was easy to  grasp, but handling the corner cases(especially when the  test cases were hidden) was a pain. Code performance was also a major factor. I 
											was unable to fix the timeout issue for problem_1 and problem_4.</p>

									<h3>Go-lang</h3>
									<p>At this point I already knew how to handle alien languages, thanks to the fact that I was already done with the Rust and Ruby tasks.<br/> <br/> Reading the docs and a bit of Googling did the trick for me.</p>

								<h2>The Project :</br> Facial expression classifier.</h2>
								<p>The Goal was to train a deep learning model to classify facial expressions. <br/> </p>

								<span class="center"><img src="images/pic02.jpg" style="width:500px;height:220px;"  alt="" /></span>

								<p>This uses OpenCV’s Haar cascades to detect and extract the facial region from the </br>webcam video feed and then displays the corresponding emoji (one of 7 classes) </br>depending on the output from the trained model.</p>

								<h2>The Kaggle Dataset : <br>Sale Price prediction of houses in Ames, Iowa</h2>
								<p>A real estate agent might be able to do this based on intuition and experience, <br/> but a computer – lacking both – might just accomplish the same.</p>

								<span class="center"><img src="images/house.jpg" style="width:500px;height:250px;"  alt="" /></span>

								<p> The data contained 81 columns, each describing a feature of the property like building type, <br>size, no. of fireplaces, neighborhood etc.  The aim was to train a model to predict the sale price<br> of houses based on the given parameters. I learnt a a lot about data pre-processing,<br> deciding which features to keep and which ones to drop, handling categorical values etc.</p>

								<h2>The Wine-quality dataset : <br>Prediction of wine quality</h2>
								<p>A wine critic is a person who evaluates wine and describes it with a numerical rating. What if we could train a computer to do the same?  </p>

								<span class="center"><img src="images/wine_cat.jpg" style="width:320px;height:250px;"  alt="" /></span>

								<p> The dataset contains 12 columns, 11 of which describe the chemical properties of wine,<br/> the last column corresponds to its quality. The quality of wine is directly correlated to its chemical composition, <br/>these chemical attributes can be used to train a deep learning model to predict its quality.</p>
