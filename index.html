								<h3>Ruby</h3>
								<p>Ruby was completely alien to me. Google was my only friend. The syntax was easy to grasp. I faced tons of errors but StackOverflow had my back.</p>
							</section>
							<section>
								<span class="center"> <img src="images/Rust_logo.png" style="width:115px;height:100px;">
								</span>
								<h3>Rust</h3>
								<p>Once again, I didn't even know that Rust-lang existed, forget about RegEx. Youtube Tutorials and the official docs came in handy.</p>

								<h3>Web</h3>
								<p>I had zero knowledge about HTML and JS, w3schools and Youtube tutorials kept me from drowning. </p>

									<span class="center" ><img src="https://img.icons8.com/dusk/128/000000/python.png"  style="width:100px;height:100px;"  >
									</span>
									
								<h3>Python</h3>
								<p>The Hackerrank and Codeforces problems brushed up my basic problem solving skills. Captcha breaking was fun, the Tesseract OCR engine came in handy. Solving Reverse-me wasn't easy though, it took me 1 whole hour to understand what a XOR gate exactly is. </p>

									<h3>GitHub_GraphQL</h3>
									<p>GraphQL was completely new to me. The learning curve was a bit steep in this case. GraphiQL(in-browser tool) came in handy for  validating and testing GraphQL queries.</p>

								<section>
									<span class="center"> <img src="images/Euler_logo.jpg" style="width:140px;height:100px;">
									</span>
									<h3>Project_Euler</h3>
									<p>The logic was easy to  grasp, but handling the corner cases(especially when the  test cases were hidden) was a pain. Code performance was also a major factor. I 
											was unable to fix the timeout issue for problem_1 and problem_4.</p>

									<h3>Go-lang</h3>
									<p>At this point I already knew how to handle alien languages, thanks to the fact that I was already done with the Rust and Ruby tasks.<br/> <br/> Reading the docs and a bit of Googling did the trick for me.</p>

								<h3>Dogs_vs_Cats image classifier</h3>
								<p>A deep learning model(2D CNN) which classifies images of dogs and cats. The purpose of this project was to get used to handling image data and to avoid completing my assignments on time. Currently I'm learning PyTorch, I'll start working on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yusufdede/lung-cancer-dataset">lung cancer dataset</a>
									 as soon as I get time to do so.</p>

								<h3>Twitter_stats_viewer</h3>
								<p>Takes the input of a Twitter username(for example RahulGandhi), a tag word(for example "Modi"), year, then plots the frequency of usage of the tag word by the user throughout the year.
								   For some reason, I'm unable to download more than 400 tweets of a single user. In the process of making this, I learnt about API's, handling CSV's and Data Visualisation. This one still need work though.
