							<p>I started coding because everybody around me was doing so,<br/>
								but then I fell in love with it.<br/>This page features the stuff I did for the past few months.</p>

								<h3>Ruby</h3>
								<p>Ruby was completely alien to me. Google was my friend. The syntax was easy to grasp. I faced tons of errors but StackOverflow had my back.</p>

								<h3>Rust</h3>
								<p>Once again, I didn't even know that Rust-lang existed, forget about RegEx. Youtube Tutorials and the official docs came in handy.</p>

								<h3>Web</h3>
								<p>I had zero knowledge about HTML and JS, w3schools and Youtube tutorials kept me from drowning. </p>

								<h3>Python</h3>
								<p>Captcha breaking was fun, the Tesseract OCR engine came in handy. Solving Reverse-me wasn't easy though, it took me 1 whole hour to understand what a XOR gate exactly is. </p>

								<h3>Dogs_vs_Cats image classifier</h3>
								<p>A deep learning model(2D CNN) which classifies images of dogs and cats. The purpose of this project was to get used to handling image data and to avoid completing my assignments on time. Currently I'm learning PyTorch, I'll start working on the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/yusufdede/lung-cancer-dataset">lung cancer dataset</a>
									 as soon as I get time to do so.</p>

								<h3>Twitter_stats_viewer</h3>
								<p>Takes the input of a Twitter username(for example RahulGandhi), a tag word(for example "Modi"), year, then plots the frequency of usage of the tag word by the user throughout the year.
								   For some reason, I'm unable to download more than 400 tweets of a single user. In the process of making this, I learnt about API's, handling CSV's and Data Visualisation. I have plans to work on the Zomato Dataset after I fix this one.
