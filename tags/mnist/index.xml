      <description>This gif showcases generated samples from a GAN trained on the MNIST dataset. Link to project repository.
Background : Last saturday, I was browsing YouTube on my phone when the algorithm suggested me a video on GANs by Computerphile. Until that point I had a vague idea of what GANs were, mostly derived from conversations with my brother, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know how they worked.
Anyways, I watched the whole video and was heavily impressed by the whole notion of making computers generate new real-looking data.</description>
